# synology-nas-settings
Settings, tweaks and hacks that I use on my Synology DS409 NAS.

Currently my NAS is running DiskStation 6x using the ["pretend to be a DS411J" hack](https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?t=79640).

Feel free to use anything you find here, but please make sure you know what you are doing and don't hold me responsible if you break your NAS!
